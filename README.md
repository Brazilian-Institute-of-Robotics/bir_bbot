# **Purpose of the Project**

Bbot, or _Balancing Robot_, is a self-balancing autonomous robot project. Our goal is to build a mobile robot operated via **ROS Noetic** capable of balancing and moving on two wheels. Furthermore, he must be able to read a TAG (fiducial framework). The TAG will send the robot a destination position to which it must autonomously navigate. To carry out navigation, this robot must be able to create a map of where it is and locate itself in it, allowing it to update its position throughout the mission and avoid obstacles while navigating to its objective. For more about this project see our web page, containing the steps for build this project, [LINK](https://mhar-vell.github.io/rasc/project-bbot/).

### Supported Versions

- **Noetic**: Built and tested under [ROS] Noetic and Ubuntu 20.04

### Dependencies 
- [ROS] : An open-source robot framework. (**Version == Noetic**)
- [Trajectory controller](http://wiki.ros.org/joint_trajectory_controller) : Controller for executing joint-space trajectories.
- [Twist mux](http://wiki.ros.org/twist_mux) : Twist multiplexer, which multiplex several velocity commands (topics) and allows to priorize or disable them (locks).
- [Teleop twist keyboard](http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_keyboard) : Generic keyboard teleop for twist robots.
- [BIR Marker Localization](https://github.com/Brazilian-Institute-of-Robotics/bir_marker_localization) : This package was made to help you find your robot with a marker. (**Clone into your src folder**)

# **Installation**

##  Building from Source:

Attention, if you haven't installed [ROS] yet, please check [Ubuntu install of ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu). Desktop-Full Install is the recommended one in order to work with this repository.  

**Building:**

First, lets create a catkin workspace.

    $ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src

Then, clone **bir_bbot** inside your workspace source. For bringup, use the branch 'feature/final'

	$ git clone git@github.com:Brazilian-Institute-of-Robotics/bir_bbot.git -b feature/final

Now, just build your catkin workspace.

    $ cd ~/catkin_ws
    $ catkin_make

Don't forget to source your workspace before using it.
    
    $ source devel/setup.bash

## Example of Usage

### Real

Just Run

	$ roslaunch bbot_bringup bbot_bringup.launch

* _Real model of Bbot._
	
### Simulation

For simulation, we have another repository, see the [bir_bbot-simulation](https://github.com/Brazilian-Institute-of-Robotics/bir_bbot-simulation), and have fun!!
